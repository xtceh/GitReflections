What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A .git folder is created to store commits and status in the future.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The repository holds commit history and the working directory holds all files being worked on but the staging area holds a list of the files that the user wishes to commit. This helps for flexibility in deciding what to commit rather than the whole working directory every time.
